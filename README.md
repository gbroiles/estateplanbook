# Understanding Your California Estate Plan

This book was accurate to the best of my information when written in 2014.

The book is available on Kindle at https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Your-California-Estate-Plan/dp/0990322807/

The relevant laws and numbers for estate, tax, probate, and Medi-Cal planning have likely changed since the book was written.

You should discuss your individual circumstances with an experienced estate planning attorney.

The author is not currently practicing law and is not available to discuss your individual circumstances or questions.
